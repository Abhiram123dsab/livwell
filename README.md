# Project Title

## Description

This is a modern web application built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Prisma as an ORM to interact with a SQLite database. The project includes features for user authentication, browsing products (juices and dishes), managing a shopping cart, and processing orders.

## Features

*   User authentication (Sign up, Sign in)
*   Browse a catalog of juices and dishes
*   View detailed information about each product
*   Add items to a shopping cart
*   Update and remove items from the cart
*   Place orders with different payment methods (COD, UPI - simulated)
*   View order history
*   User profile management (basic)

## Technologies Used

*   Next.js
*   React
*   Prisma (ORM)
*   SQLite (Database Engine)
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```
bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    
```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
```
bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    
```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on the `.env.example` (if you have one).
    Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file points to your SQLite database file (e.g., `file:./prisma/dev.db`).
```
dotenv
    DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
    # Add any other environment variables
    
```
## Database

This project uses SQLite as the database, managed with Prisma.

*   **Database Schema:** The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
*   **Running Migrations:** To create the database tables based on the schema, run the migrations:
```
bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    
```
(If you make changes to `schema.prisma`, run this command again to generate and apply a new migration.)
*   **Seeding the Database:** To populate the database with initial data, run the seed script:
```
bash
    npx prisma db seed
    
```
*   **Prisma Studio:** To visualize and interact with your database, you can use Prisma Studio:
```
bash
    npx prisma studio
    
```
## Running the Project

```
bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
